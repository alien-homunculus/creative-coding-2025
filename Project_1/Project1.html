               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate">  I was excited to see all the taxidermied animals, specimen samples, real insects etc </marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate">  But the most eyecatching exhibition was the real life leaf cutter ant terrarium.</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate">  The terrarium was spread with leaves and branches.</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate">  There were bridges that the ants can cross by to their habitat</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate">  We were able to see how they managed and operate their kingdom through the glass wall</marquee>
               
               <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate">  Leaf cutter ants especially, use leaves to build their houses.</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate">  So we were able to see the ants carry leaves to their home</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate"> It was like seeing a congo line of leaves going up and down</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate"> People were coming to see how the ants tiny brains could make amazing engineered houses with leaves and dirt</marquee>
        
               <marquee direction="left" behavior="alternate"> From seeing these ants build a colony from computer screens to seeing it in real life</marquee>
       
               <marquee direction="right" behavior="alternate"> It was the most memorable experience I had in the past year.</marquee>
